So, I've decided to start blogging. I doubt this will be the kind of blog where I express my extreme opinions on some political events, but rather a collection of geeky things I've found or created. In the coming months I'll be blogging about some of things I've done since I left uni, and some of things I've learnt. But for now, here's a site I wish I'd known about whilst writing my masters thesis: <a href = "http://web.archive.org/web/20130501065142/http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikiquote</a>. With Wikiquote, I could have peppered my thesis with great quotes such as:
<blockquote>
Numbers exist only in our minds. There is no physical entity that is number 1. If there were, 1 would be in a place of honor in some great museum of science, and past it would file a steady stream of mathematicians gazing at 1 in wonder and awe.
</blockquote>
Or, I could have gone old school with some Chris Rock:
<blockquote>
    Do you know what the good side of crack is? If you're up at the right hour, you can get a VCR for $1.50. You can furnish your whole house for $10.95.
