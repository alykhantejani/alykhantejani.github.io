This summer I have a few months before I begin my computer vision research at Imperial College, so I proclaim this <a href = "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPS3qLtaFtw">The Summer of <del>George</del> Aly!</a>
<br />
<br />
I’ve decided to go traveling in India and am actually writing this post from a hotel in Manali overlooking the Himalayan mountains.

The first stop was Amritsar, Punjab. Here I visited the Golden Temple, which is one of Sikhism’s most holy places as it houses the Adi Granth, which is the Sikh holy book. It is called Golden as the temple itself is covered in gold, which was done for protection rather than beauty both of which have been achieved.

I visited in the day and at night as the views are very different. At both times there were many pilgrims taking dips in the holy lake, however at night the temperature is more bearable and I queued to go inside the temple (no photography allowed).
