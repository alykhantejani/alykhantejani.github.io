##Past

I obtained a Masters of Engineering (MEng) in Computer Science (2010) and a Masters of Philosophy (MPhil) in Computer Vision (2014) both from Imperial College, London. In between these, I worked as a  software engineer at Goldman Sachs for 2 years.  
<br />
My previous research interests were focussed on Random Forests, mostly applied to pose estimation, both for articulated hand pose and for multiple instances of textureless 3D objects. From this, I obtained two top publications at CVPR and ECCV as well as two patents. For more information, see below.

##Present
Currently, I work as a Senior Research Engineer at Blippar. In this role, I co-wrote the augmented reality tracking engine for mobile devices, currently used by our app. However, in the more recent months I have shifted my focus to deep learning being applied to large-scale visual object recognition (Blippar's visual browser). Our work in this field has been showcased in many major news outlets such as <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2993742/Forget-words-Blippar-app-lets-search-web-using-smartphone-CAMERA.html">The Daily Mail</a>, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11473374/Blippar-develops-visual-browser-for-the-physical-world.html"> The Telegraph</a> and <a href="http://www.wsj.com/video/a-search-engine-powered-by-your-smartphone-camera/65D77C0F-C710-47AD-919C-0D0E3FF95CF3.html">The Wall Stree Journal</a>.  Additionally, it has been demoed on major TV stations such as <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-03-18/-blipp-it-augmented-reality-comes-to-advertising?utm_content=buffer08438&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer">Bloomberg</a> <a href="http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000377421">CNBC</a>, <a href="http://www.myfoxny.com/story/29057765/what-does-blippar-app-do">Fox News NY</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhZAxBR6lko">BBC London News</a>.
