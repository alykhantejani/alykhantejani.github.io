##Past

I obtained a Masters of Engineering (MEng) in Computer Science (2010) and a Masters of Philosophy (MPhil) in Computer Vision (2014) both from Imperial College, London. In between, I did a 2 year stint as a software engineer at Goldman Sachs.

My previous research interests were focussed on Random Forests, mostly applied to pose estimation, both for articulated hand pose and for multiple instances of textureless 3D objects. From this, I obtained two top publications at CVPR and ECCV as well as two patents. For more information, see below.

##Present
Currently, I work as a Senior Research Engineer at Blippar. In this role, I co-wrote the augmented reality tracking engine for mobile devices, currently used by our app. However, in the more recent months I have shifted my focus to deep learning being applied to large-scale visual object recognition (Blippar's visual browser). Our work in this field has been showcased in the press, for example: 

Additionally, it has been demoed on TV stations such as CNBC, Fox News NY and BBC London.
